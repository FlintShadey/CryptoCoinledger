The Gala:
  copy the data to PDF (open in preview is fine)
  collect the text into a rtfd file (later change this to txt file)
  clean  up the data
  then you have to set the known date and the program will just count backward daily
  it will stil have problems with floats

The FLUX is two steps, you can capture the FLUX amounts, but then have to run fluxDateCapture seperately and input that into the csv editor
  the PDF method works fine for this 
  use google sheets

the POKT is CSV to CSV

Coinledger requires csv to have columns "Date (UTC)", "Platform (Optional)", "Asset Sent", "Amount Sent", "Asset Received", "Amount Received", "Fee Currency (Optional)", "Fee Amount (Optional)", "Type", "Description (Optional)", "TxHash (Optional)"
