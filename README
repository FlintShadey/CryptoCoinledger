just select the distributions and save to a txt file 


correct and SAVE the csv file before sending to coinledger

---------------------------------
FLUX 
when working on FLUX make sure you have the correct wallet.   the distributions are 2.8125  (not 37.5)

I hard coded the 2.8125 .... i dont know how else to parse them

again save the file as CSV before proceeding

----------------------------------
the POKT is CSV to CSV
----------------
Coinledger requires csv to have columns "Date (UTC)", "Platform (Optional)", "Asset Sent", "Amount Sent", "Asset Received", "Amount Received", "Fee Currency (Optional)", "Fee Amount (Optional)", "Type", "Description (Optional)", "TxHash (Optional)"
