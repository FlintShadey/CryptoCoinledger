The FLUX is two steps, you can capture the FLUX amounts, but then have to run fluxDateCapture seperately and input that into the csv editor
  navigate to the node -> explorer copy Text into a txt file run the script
  
  then run the date capture

  The text date capture has not been tested yet

When the text is available, it will just print the dates in the terminal, this needs to be combined with the flux CSV output script
